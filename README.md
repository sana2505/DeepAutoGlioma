DeepAutoGlioma: a deep learning autoencoder-based multi-omics data integration and classification tools for glioma subtyping

Sana Munquad & Asim Bikas Das

#Whole Framework

1. Two different types of data was used.

2. Identified survival associated differentially expressed gene and survival associated differentially methylated regions.

3. Developed a biological interpretable deep learning model named DeepAutoGlioma

#Steps

1. Feature selection
a. Identification of biological relevant features

b. Identification of clinical relevant features

2. Data integration by autoencoder

3 Development of DL model (DeepAutoGlioma)
